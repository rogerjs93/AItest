"Handwritten Digit Recognition Web App is an interactive machine learning application that utilizes a deep learning model trained on the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits. The project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for digit classification, implemented using TensorFlow and Keras, and a user-friendly web interface built with Flask. Users can upload images of handwritten digits, and the web app processes these images to predict the corresponding numerical values with high accuracy. This project showcases the power of deep learning techniques in computer vision tasks and provides an accessible way to experiment with digit recognition for educational and practical purposes."
